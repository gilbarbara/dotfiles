# Sync with Agent Hub

Sync with the MCP Agent Hub to get the complete collaboration state including messages, workload, and updates.

I'll perform a comprehensive sync:

⏺ agent-hub - sync (MCP)(
  agentId: current agent ID,
  markAsRead: true
)

## Sync Components

### 📬 Messages
Based on message types, I'll:
- **📋 Context** - Integrate shared context updates
- **🎯 Task** - Review assignments and coordinate dependencies
- **❓ Question** - Answer questions and provide clarification
- **✅ Completion** - Acknowledge completed work
- **⚠️ Error** - Address issues and provide assistance
- **🔄 Sync Request** - Respond to synchronous requests

### 📋 Current Workload
- Active features I'm working on
- Pending delegations assigned to me
- Subtasks and their current status
- Priority levels and deadlines

### 🌐 Hub Status
- Other active agents and their capabilities
- Available features for collaboration
- Recent activity and collaboration opportunities

## Sync Actions

For each component, I'll:
- 📝 **Summarize** key information and changes
- 🎯 **Take action** based on priority and urgency
- 💬 **Respond** to messages requiring replies
- 📊 **Update** local context with new information
- 🔄 **Coordinate** with other agents as needed

If no updates are found, I'll confirm everything is current and show the last sync timestamp.
