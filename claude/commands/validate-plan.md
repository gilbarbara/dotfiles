Validate the entire plan by:

1) Checking the actual source implementation
2) Researching best practices via Exa for real-world examples (**if needed**)
3) Identifying potential edge cases and failure modes
4) Confirming compatibility with existing systems.

Provide a detailed, production-ready plan with no workarounds or temporary fixes.
